- updated the testing_trainedNN.py so that jetPredictions folder now has time string appended to its name to make sure there is no overwrite
- there was issue with plotting of the fit plots that I believe is due to the data so I implemented try except blocks and it resolves the issue
- started jobs for testing Felixed trained NN model with jets.csv and JZ*.csv
- later date string means higher JZ number
